# Transcript Platform - Project Status

## **Current State**

### **COMPLETED**
- **Data Pipeline**: CSV → JSON → TypeScript conversion with smart caching
- **Data Models**: vendors + affiliates data with validation
- **Build System**: Automated pipeline with `npm run prebuild` and dependency management
- **Command Structure**: Consistent naming with default commands (`convert`, `compile`, `validate`)
- **Next.js App**: Building and running


### **Architecture**
- **Pattern**: Data-driven, build-time compilation with smart caching
- **Storage**: CSV files → JSON → static TypeScript
- **Performance**: Build-time processing, instant runtime loading
- **Command Design**: Default commands for normal operations, individual commands for debugging

## **Open Questions & Issues**

### **Data Management**
- **Update Frequency**: How often should vendor data be refreshed?
- **Data Sources**: Should we integrate with vendor APIs for real-time updates?
- **Validation**: Do we need automated data quality monitoring?

### **User Experience**
- **Search Algorithm**: What search/filtering approach for 25+ vendors?
- **Mobile Design**: Priority for mobile-first vs. desktop-first?
- **Performance**: Acceptable page load times for vendor comparisons?

### **Technical Decisions**
- **State Management**: React Context vs. Zustand vs. Redux?
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS sufficient or need component library?
- **Testing**: Unit tests vs. integration tests priority?

### **Build System & Caching**
- **Cache Coherency**: How to ensure reliable file change detection across platforms?
  - **Current**: Timestamp + hash + size checking with smart caching
  - **Options**: Content hash-based, hybrid timestamp+hash, incremental processing
  - **Challenges**: Cross-platform compatibility, performance vs. reliability trade-offs
  - **Status**: Implemented and documented in Commands.md, working well
- **Dependency Resolution**: Hard-coded processing order (vendors → affiliates → compile)
- **File Watching**: Build-time checking (current), real-time monitoring (future consideration)

## **Market Segment Strategy**

### **Current Challenge**
Platform has evolved from focused target (amateur/professional content creators + agencies) to broader user base including business professionals, researchers, and individual consumers. Need strategic approach for handling multiple market segments effectively.

### **Proposed Approaches to Evaluate**

#### **Option 1: Unified Experience with Smart Segmentation**
- **Strategy**: Single platform experience with intelligent content/feature adaptation
- **Implementation**: User type detection, contextual recommendations, adaptive interfaces
- **Pros**: Consistent brand, shared infrastructure, cross-segment learning
- **Cons**: Complex logic, potential feature bloat, harder to optimize for specific segments
- **Risk Level**: Medium (complexity in user experience logic)

#### **Option 2: Segment-Specific Experiences**
- **Strategy**: Different interfaces and workflows for different user types
- **Implementation**: User type selection, segment-specific navigation, tailored content
- **Pros**: Optimized for each segment, clear user paths, easier to customize
- **Cons**: Development complexity, maintenance overhead, potential user confusion
- **Risk Level**: High (significant development and maintenance effort)

#### **Option 3: Progressive Disclosure by Segment**
- **Strategy**: Start with core experience, progressively reveal segment-specific features
- **Implementation**: Base functionality for all users, advanced features by user type
- **Pros**: Gradual complexity, shared foundation, segment-specific value
- **Cons**: May not serve any segment optimally, complex progressive logic
- **Risk Level**: Medium-High (balancing simplicity with segment needs)

#### **Option 4: Hybrid Approach with Core + Extensions**
- **Strategy**: Common core experience with segment-specific modules/features
- **Implementation**: Shared platform + segment-specific components and workflows
- **Pros**: Balance of consistency and customization, modular development
- **Cons**: Architecture complexity, integration challenges, maintenance overhead
- **Risk Level**: Medium (moderate complexity with good flexibility)

### **Key Questions to Resolve**
1. **Primary vs. Secondary Segments**: Which segments are core vs. expansion opportunities?
2. **Feature Overlap**: What features serve multiple segments vs. segment-specific needs?
3. **Development Priority**: Should we build for all segments simultaneously or prioritize?
4. **User Experience**: Can we maintain quality while serving diverse needs?
5. **Business Model**: How do different segments impact monetization and growth?

### **Recommended Steps**
1. **Segment Analysis**: Deep dive into each user type's needs and pain points
2. **Feature Mapping**: Identify which features serve which segments
3. **Experience Design**: Create user journey maps for each segment
4. **Technical Architecture**: Design system to support chosen approach
5. **Validation**: Test approach with representative users from each segment


## **Current Command Structure**

### **Default Commands (Recommended)**
- **`npm run convert`** - Process all CSV data (vendors + affiliates) with automatic dependency management
- **`npm run compile`** - Compile JSON data to TypeScript after processing
- **`npm run validate`** - Validate all data integrity and consistency

### **Individual Commands (Debugging)**
- **`npm run convert:vendors`** - Process vendor CSV only for debugging
- **`npm run convert:affiliates`** - Process affiliate CSV only for debugging
- **`npm run validate:vendors`** - Validate vendor data only for debugging
- **`npm run validate:affiliates`** - Validate affiliate data only for debugging

### **Build System Commands**
- **`npm run prebuild`** - Smart data processing before build
- **`npm run build`** - Production build with automatic data handling
- **`npm run rebuild`** - Force rebuild everything for troubleshooting

## **Next Steps**

### **Core UI Components**
- **VendorCard**: Individual vendor display component
- **VendorList**: Grid/list view with basic filtering
- **SearchBar**: Text search functionality
- **Basic Layout**: Navigation and page structure

### **Search & Discovery**
- **Advanced Filtering**: Category, price, capability filters
- **Sorting**: Multiple sort options (price, rating, name)
- **Search Results**: Pagination and result display
- **Vendor Pages**: Individual vendor detail views

### **Immediate Tasks**
1. **Component Architecture**: Design reusable component system
2. **Data Integration**: Connect UI components to existing data
3. **Basic Styling**: Implement Tailwind CSS design system
4. **Routing**: Set up vendor detail page routes

## **Recent Improvements**

### **Documentation & Command Structure**
- **Commands.md**: Completely rewritten for clarity, consistency, and reduced redundancy
- **Command Naming**: Consistent script file names (`convert-vendors.ts`, `compile-all.ts`, etc.)
- **Default Commands**: `convert`, `compile`, `validate` work as defaults for all data
- **Smart Caching**: Implemented and working with timestamp + hash + size checking
- **Dependency Management**: Automatic processing order enforcement (vendors → affiliates → compile)
