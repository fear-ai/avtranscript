# Transcript Platform - Project Status

## **Current State**

### **COMPLETED**
- **Data Pipeline**: CSV → JSON → TypeScript conversion
- **Data Models**: vendors + affiliates data
- **Build System**: Automated pipeline with `npm run prebuild`
- **Next.js App**: Building and running


### **Architecture**
- **Pattern**: Data-driven, build-time compilation
- **Storage**: CSV files → static TypeScript
- **Performance**: Build-time processing, instant runtime loading

## **Open Questions & Issues**

### **Data Management**
- **Update Frequency**: How often should vendor data be refreshed?
- **Data Sources**: Should we integrate with vendor APIs for real-time updates?
- **Validation**: Do we need automated data quality monitoring?

### **User Experience**
- **Search Algorithm**: What search/filtering approach for 25+ vendors?
- **Mobile Design**: Priority for mobile-first vs. desktop-first?
- **Performance**: Acceptable page load times for vendor comparisons?

### **Technical Decisions**
- **State Management**: React Context vs. Zustand vs. Redux?
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS sufficient or need component library?
- **Testing**: Unit tests vs. integration tests priority?

## **Market Segment Strategy**

### **Current Challenge**
Platform has evolved from focused target (amateur/professional content creators + agencies) to broader user base including business professionals, researchers, and individual consumers. Need strategic approach for handling multiple market segments effectively.

### **Proposed Approaches to Evaluate**

#### **Option 1: Unified Experience with Smart Segmentation**
- **Strategy**: Single platform experience with intelligent content/feature adaptation
- **Implementation**: User type detection, contextual recommendations, adaptive interfaces
- **Pros**: Consistent brand, shared infrastructure, cross-segment learning
- **Cons**: Complex logic, potential feature bloat, harder to optimize for specific segments
- **Risk Level**: Medium (complexity in user experience logic)

#### **Option 2: Segment-Specific Experiences**
- **Strategy**: Different interfaces and workflows for different user types
- **Implementation**: User type selection, segment-specific navigation, tailored content
- **Pros**: Optimized for each segment, clear user paths, easier to customize
- **Cons**: Development complexity, maintenance overhead, potential user confusion
- **Risk Level**: High (significant development and maintenance effort)

#### **Option 3: Progressive Disclosure by Segment**
- **Strategy**: Start with core experience, progressively reveal segment-specific features
- **Implementation**: Base functionality for all users, advanced features by user type
- **Pros**: Gradual complexity, shared foundation, segment-specific value
- **Cons**: May not serve any segment optimally, complex progressive logic
- **Risk Level**: Medium-High (balancing simplicity with segment needs)

#### **Option 4: Hybrid Approach with Core + Extensions**
- **Strategy**: Common core experience with segment-specific modules/features
- **Implementation**: Shared platform + segment-specific components and workflows
- **Pros**: Balance of consistency and customization, modular development
- **Cons**: Architecture complexity, integration challenges, maintenance overhead
- **Risk Level**: Medium (moderate complexity with good flexibility)

### **Key Questions to Resolve**
1. **Primary vs. Secondary Segments**: Which segments are core vs. expansion opportunities?
2. **Feature Overlap**: What features serve multiple segments vs. segment-specific needs?
3. **Development Priority**: Should we build for all segments simultaneously or prioritize?
4. **User Experience**: Can we maintain quality while serving diverse needs?
5. **Business Model**: How do different segments impact monetization and growth?

### **Recommended Steps**
1. **Segment Analysis**: Deep dive into each user type's needs and pain points
2. **Feature Mapping**: Identify which features serve which segments
3. **Experience Design**: Create user journey maps for each segment
4. **Technical Architecture**: Design system to support chosen approach
5. **Validation**: Test approach with representative users from each segment


## **Next Steps**

### **Core UI Components**
- **VendorCard**: Individual vendor display component
- **VendorList**: Grid/list view with basic filtering
- **SearchBar**: Text search functionality
- **Basic Layout**: Navigation and page structure

### **Search & Discovery**
- **Advanced Filtering**: Category, price, capability filters
- **Sorting**: Multiple sort options (price, rating, name)
- **Search Results**: Pagination and result display
- **Vendor Pages**: Individual vendor detail views

### **Immediate Tasks**
1. **Component Architecture**: Design reusable component system
2. **Data Integration**: Connect UI components to existing data
3. **Basic Styling**: Implement Tailwind CSS design system
4. **Routing**: Set up vendor detail page routes
