# Transcript Platform - Project Status

## **Architecture**
- **Pattern**: Data-driven, build-time compilation with smart caching
- **Storage**: CSV files ‚Üí JSON ‚Üí static TypeScript
- **Performance**: Build-time processing, instant runtime loading
- **Command Design**: Default commands for normal operations, individual commands for debugging

## **üìä Current State**

### **COMPLETED** ‚úÖ
- **Data Pipeline**: CSV ‚Üí JSON ‚Üí TypeScript conversion with smart caching
- **Data Models**: vendors + affiliates data with validation
- **Build System**: Automated pipeline with `npm run prebuild` and dependency management
- **Command Structure**: Consistent naming with default commands (`convert`, `compile`, `validate`)
- **Next.js App**: Building and running successfully
- **VendorCard Component**: Consolidated into single responsive component
- **Error Handling**: Unified error handling system implemented
- **TypeScript**: All compilation errors resolved
- **Type Cards**: Interactive user type selection working

### **Known Issues** ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Import Pattern Inconsistency**: Mixed import styles across codebase (medium priority)
- **Minor Code Consolidation**: Some command execution patterns could be further unified (low priority)

### **Recently Resolved Issues** ‚úÖ
- **React onClick Handler Issues**: Fixed by adding ComplexityProvider to _app.tsx
- **TypeScript Compilation Errors**: All resolved across the application
- **VendorCard Duplication**: Consolidated 5 variants into single responsive component
- **Layout Import Issues**: Fixed component import consistency

## **More Tasks** üìã **REFERENCE ONLY**
*Note: Detailed task information has been moved to Topics.md
- **Learn Page Creation**: Replace `#learn` anchor with dedicated `/learn` page
- **Reusable User Type Component**: Create component with 3 radio buttons
- **Search Box Redesign**: Completely redo search functionality  
- **Individual Vendor Pages**: Create dedicated page for each vendor
- **Mobile Testing**: Test application functionality on mobile devices
- **About Page**: Create dedicated About page
- **Contact & Support Handling**: Implement contact and support functionality

## **üèóÔ∏è Market Segment Strategy** üìã **REFERENCE ONLY**
*Note: Detailed strategy information has been moved to Topics.md
- **Current Challenge**: Platform evolved from focused target to broader user base
- **Recommended Approach**: Unified experience with smart segmentation
- **Implementation**: Phased approach with decoupled context system
- **Key Questions**: Primary vs. secondary segments, feature overlap, development priority

## **üìö Documentation Management Challenges** **REFERENCE ONLY**
*Note: Detailed task information has been moved to Docs.md
- **Problem**: Tracking documentation and implementation becomes increasingly difficult
- **Symptoms**:
  - **Content Ballooning**: Documentation grows exponentially, hard to maintain
  - **Update Tracking**: Difficult to know what's current vs. outdated
  - **Implementation Gaps**: Documentation doesn't match actual code
  - **Maintenance Overhead**: Time spent updating docs instead of building features
- **Causes**:
  - **Monolithic Approach**: Single large documents become unwieldy
  - **Separate Tracking**: Documentation and implementation drift apart
  - **Date Obsession**: Focus on timestamps rather than content relevance
  - **Status Proliferation**: Too many status categories and progress indicators
- **Impact**: Reduced development velocity, confusion, technical debt accumulation

## **üöÄ Work Tomorrow**

### **Development Priorities**
1. **Import Pattern Standardization**
   - Review and standardize import patterns across the codebase
   - Create import path constants for consistency
   - Update component imports to use consistent patterns

2. **Minor Code Consolidation**
   - Identify remaining command execution patterns that could be unified
   - Create utilities for common operations if beneficial

### **Testing & Validation**
1. **Mobile Testing**: Test responsive design on mobile devices
2. **TypeCard Functionality**: Verify user type selection works correctly
3. **VendorCard Display**: Test different screen sizes and complexity levels

### **Documentation Updates**
1. **Review Topics.md**: Check for new areas that need investigation
2. **CodeImprovements.md**: Track any new code quality issues
