- **File Watching**: Build-time checking (current), real-time monitoring (future consideration)

### **React onClick() Handler Issues** ‚ö†Ô∏è **INVESTIGATION NEEDED**
- **Problem**: `onClick` handlers not appearing in HTML output during server-side rendering
- **Symptoms**: 
  - Type cards show `cursor-pointer` but no `onClick` attributes in HTML
  - React components not fully hydrated on client side
  - Silent failures without JavaScript errors
- **Root Cause Investigation**:
  - **Provider Context**: `ComplexityProvider` was missing from `_app.tsx` (FIXED)
  - **Server-Side Rendering**: `onClick` handlers stripped during SSR due to missing context
  - **Hydration Mismatch**: Server renders one state, client has different initial state
- **Solutions Attempted**:
  1. **Provider Fix**: Added `ComplexityProvider` to `_app.tsx` ‚úÖ
  2. **Memoized Handlers**: Used `useCallback` for click handlers ‚úÖ
  3. **Button Elements**: Converted `div` to `button` elements ‚úÖ
- **Current Status**: Type cards working but `onClick` handlers still not visible in HTML
- **Learning Points**:
  - **Context Dependencies**: React hooks require proper provider wrapping
  - **SSR Hydration**: Server-side rendering can strip client-side event handlers
  - **Debugging Strategy**: Check provider context, component hydration, and SSR behavior
  - **Alternative Approaches**: Consider client-only components or different event handling patterns
- **Next Steps**: 
  - Investigate why `onClick` handlers still not appearing in HTML
  - Consider using `onMouseDown` or other event handlers as alternatives
  - Research Next.js SSR hydration best practices for interactive components

## **Market Segment Strategy**

### **Current Challenge**
Platform has evolved from focused target (amateur/professional content creators + agencies) to broader user base including business professionals, researchers, and individual consumers. Need strategic approach for handling multiple market segments effectively.

### **User Experience Design Insights**

#### **Starting Point Strategy**
- **Professional Mid as Default**: Start with balanced, professional-focused experience that serves most users well
- **Smart Auto-Adjustment**: When user selects different user type, automatically adjust complexity level:
  - Amateur ‚Üí Low complexity (simple, beginner-friendly)
  - Professional ‚Üí Mid complexity (balanced, user's choice)
  - Agency ‚Üí High complexity (detailed, enterprise-focused)
- **Manual Override**: Users can always manually adjust complexity level from auto-selection

#### **Complexity Implementation Integration** üîß **DESIGN COMPLEXITY ALIGNMENT**
- **DesignComplex.md Integration**: Market segments and customer types must align with complexity implementation
- **User Type ‚Üî Complexity Mapping**:
  - **Amateur (Free)**: Low complexity by default, simplified interface, essential features only
  - **Professional (Plus)**: Mid complexity by default, balanced features, user choice preserved
  - **Agency (Enterprise)**: High complexity by default, comprehensive features, advanced capabilities
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Complexity levels should enhance rather than replace user type features
- **Consistent Behavior**: Same complexity level should behave identically across all user types

#### **Terminology & User Interface**
- **Complexity Levels**: Use "Show More/Less" terminology (clear, action-oriented)
  - Low: "Show Less" - Essential information only
  - Mid: "Show Standard" - Balanced overview  
  - High: "Show More" - Comprehensive details
- **User Types**: Use case-based terminology (clear purpose)
  - Amateur: "Home & Personal" - Personal projects, hobbies, learning
  - Professional: "Work & Business" - Professional content creation
  - Agency: "Enterprise & Scale" - Large teams and organizations

#### **Key Design Principles**
1. **Decouple Concerns**: User type (business logic) and complexity level (UI/UX) should be independent
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Start simple, allow users to increase detail as needed
3. **Smart Defaults**: Provide intelligent starting points that users can customize
4. **Clear Visual Feedback**: Show current settings and available adjustments

### **Proposed Approaches to Evaluate**

#### **Option 1: Unified Experience with Smart Segmentation** ‚≠ê **RECOMMENDED**
- **Strategy**: Single platform experience with intelligent content/feature adaptation

   ```typescript
   // Separate contexts for different concerns
   <UserTypeProvider initialType="professional">
     <ComplexityProvider initialLevel="mid">
       <App />
     </ComplexityProvider>
   </UserTypeProvider>
   ```

2. **Smart Defaults with Auto-Adjustment**
   - Professional user type + Mid complexity as default
   - Auto-adjust complexity when user type changes
   - Allow manual override of complexity level

3. **Clear Visual Controls**
   - User type selector with icons and descriptions
   - Complexity controls (Show More/Less) with clear labels
   - Current settings display

#### **Phase 2: Content Adaptation** (Weeks 3-4)
1. **User Type Filtering**
   - Search criteria adaptation based on user type
   - Content recommendations by segment
   - Pricing and feature filtering

2. **Complexity Level Display**
   - Vendor card detail levels
   - Comparison tool complexity
   - Search result detail options

#### **Phase 3: Advanced Features** (Weeks 5-6)
1. **Smart Fallbacks**
   - Handle content with fewer complexity levels
   - Graceful degradation when features unavailable
   - User guidance for optimal experience

2. **User Preference Persistence**
   - Remember user selections
   - Quick reset to defaults
   - Personalized recommendations

### **Technical Architecture**

#### **Context Structure**
```typescript
// UserTypeContext - Business logic
interface UserTypeContextValue {
  userType: UserType;
  setUserType: (type: UserType) => void;
  searchCriteria: SearchCriteria;
  recommendations: Recommendation[];
  pricingPreferences: PricingPreferences;
}

// ComplexityContext - UI/UX preferences  
interface ComplexityContextValue {
  level: ComplexityLevel;
  setLevel: (level: ComplexityLevel) => void;
  availableLevels: ComplexityLevel[];
  canUpgrade: boolean;
  canDowngrade: boolean;
  getEffectiveLevel: (availableLevels: ComplexityLevel[]) => ComplexityLevel;
}
```

#### **Smart Level Resolution**
```typescript
// Handle content with fewer complexity levels
const getEffectiveLevel = (requestedLevel: ComplexityLevel, availableLevels: ComplexityLevel[]): ComplexityLevel => {
  const levelOrder: ComplexityLevel[] = ['low', 'mid', 'high'];
  const requestedIndex = levelOrder.indexOf(requestedLevel);
  
  // Find highest available level <= requested level
  for (let i = requestedIndex; i >= 0; i--) {
    if (availableLevels.includes(levelOrder[i])) {
      return levelOrder[i];
    }
  }
  
  return availableLevels[0] || 'low';
};
```

### **Key Questions to Resolve**
1. **Primary vs. Secondary Segments**: Which segments are core vs. expansion opportunities?
2. **Feature Overlap**: What features serve multiple segments vs. segment-specific needs?
3. **Development Priority**: Should we build for all segments simultaneously or prioritize?
4. **User Experience**: Can we maintain quality while serving diverse needs?
5. **Business Model**: How do different segments impact monetization and growth?

### **Recommended Steps**
