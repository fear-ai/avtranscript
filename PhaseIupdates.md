# PhaseI.md Update Plan

## **Core Issues to Address**

### **1. Status Accuracy**
- **Problem**: Claims "100% complete" when in active development
- **Action**: Change completion language to development status throughout

### **2. Logical Structure**
- **Problem**: Redundant sections, unclear hierarchy, scattered implementation details
- **Action**: Consolidate into logical flow: Status → Built → In Progress → Planned

### **3. Content Reconciliation**
- **Problem**: Design choices and code examples don't match actual implementation
- **Action**: Align documented features with what's actually built

### **4. User Strategy Alignment**
- **Problem**: Shows expanded user base instead of focused Amateur/Professional/Agency approach
- **Action**: Update to match Site.md strategy (user types documented in STATUS.md)

---

## **Immediate Actions**

### **Status Language Updates**
- Remove "100% complete" and "production-ready" claims
- Update "Phase I Success Criteria" to show actual completion status
- Align "Search & Discovery" status across all sections

### **Content Consolidation**
- Merge "Data Requirements" and "Data Models" sections
- Consolidate scattered technical implementation details

## **New Document Structure**

### **1. Project Status (Current State)**
- Active development status
- What's actually working vs. planned
- Current challenges and blockers

### **2. What's Built (Data Infrastructure)**
- CSV → JSON → TypeScript pipeline
- Next.js setup and basic components
- Data models and validation

### **3. What's In Progress (UI Development)**
- User interface components
- Search functionality implementation
- User experience design

### **4. What's Planned (Future Features)**
- Advanced search and filtering
- Complete UI/UX implementation
- Testing and validation

### **5. Next Steps (Actionable Items)**
- Immediate development priorities
- Technical decisions needed
- Phase I completion criteria

## **Tasks Considered**

### **Remove Unimplemented Features**
- Delete code examples for features not built
- Keep only what's actually implemented


**Note**: User types and market segments strategy is documented in STATUS.md
